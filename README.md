My CV


This is a TypeScript based custom CV website using webpack for bundling.

Specials:
 - app shell (start page)
 - service worker
 - web app manifest
   - enabled for "add to homescreen" (at least it should be)
 - async content fetching 
 - offline first
 - should look good on printers/pdf's (css-grid got some issues with page-breaks)
 
 # Source
 Source is inside the dev branch.
 Deployment is manually copy-pasting so far.
